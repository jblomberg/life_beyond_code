Beliefs can be in conflict, paradoxical, and dissonant. This system hopefully
moves over time to a state of less conflict.

# Spirituality

* There is no sentient higher power
* After death, life stops. No soul, no spirit.
* Magic is manipulation of the fallible human brain.
* Miracles exist in the perception of that same fallible (and hopeful) brain.

# People

* Are not inherently good or evil.
* Have to find their purpose.
* It is easy & common for people to assume other people are dumb or malicious.
* It is more likely that other people have different values which lead to
  different decisions.

# Science

* A human endeavor to learn about the universe.
	* Flawed (because we are imperfect)
	* Still the best method to advance our understanding.
* Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
* Probabilistically, alien life exists.
* Due to the size of the universe (and physics), we'll never meet another
  intelligent form of life.

# Society

## Governance

* Government exists to serve the people.
* People have to decide how they want government to serve them.
* Law is the tool of government.

## Law

* Law's primary purpose is to protect society from damaging behaviors.
* Inequality of basic rights is a damaging behavior
	* Different is not wrong
* Law is easily manipulated to serve the desires of powerful groups.
	* These desires are often in conflict with law's primary purpose.
* Drawing the line where law should stop (avoiding the nanny state) isn't a
  simple matter.
* By accepting governance, people are responsible for observing the laws.
	* Civil disobedience is a valid form of protesting the "rightness" of a
      law.

# Health

* We have two choices: rust out or wear out.
* Mental & physical health are linked.
* Vaccinations are one of our best tools to protect from communicable disease.
	* Choosing to not vaccinate puts society at risk due to lowered herd
      immunity.
	* Vaccinations may have damaging effects on children, but science has not
      shown that to be true (absence of evidence is not the evidence of
      absence)

# Animals

* Assuming responsibility for a pet is a commitment for the duration of that
  animal's life.
  * Forsaking that responsibility is equivalent to abandoning a family member
    in need.
* Livestock are not pets. They are a source of food.
* Cruelty to animals is a failing of morality.
* It is possible to raise & slaughter livestock for food without being cruel.
* A household should not own more than 3 cats. For a variety of reasons.
* I love dogs
* I love cats, but not as much as dogs.
